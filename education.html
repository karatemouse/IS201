                        <p> I went to LEAF which was our homeschool co-op when I was a kid. Even though it was so long ago it has shaped much of how I grew up and how I learned to learn that it deserves its own spot on this list.</p>

                        <p>I had to take one class at the community college because BYU-I didn't offer any online classes with the right History tag so my High School wouldn't accept the credit. I didn't like the teacher who taught that credit at Williamsburg so I decided to take one class at Green River which was Ancient World Civilizations.</p>
