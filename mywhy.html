                        <h2> My Why and How I am Going to Get There</h2>
                        <p>The main goal I have is to learn as much as possible. The more education I have the more I know and the better I can understand the world. To formulate my own identity I need to know what is out there. I can’t make wise decisions if I do not see more than my tiny section of the picture. It may be impossible for anybody to see the full picture. However, I want to be able to see as much as possible so I need to do my best to reach the impossible. </p>
                        <p>Through the classes I have taken, I have learned about various topics and reached a higher level of understanding. Through the people I have met, I have learned from different perspectives and gained a better understanding of those around me. Through living on my own I have learned and will continue to learn to be a capable and independent adult. Every aspect of life is an opportunity to learn something. The environment of BYU cultivates both new growth and learning and reinforces things already learned.</p>
                        <p>As of now, I am planning on applying to the Experience Design Management program. I do not know exactly how my future will plan out or if I will be accepted into that program but I know that learning what I can while at this age will help propel me throughout the rest of my life. I don’t know what I want to do professionally or if I even want a profession, but I do know that education can have a greater impact than simply getting a job. </p>
                        <p>I can’t expect perfection in my professional and educational endeavors but I know I will try. I have a strong belief in doing my best. If I am not doing my best I am wasting the opportunity to improve. </p>
                        <p>Along with doing my best is the idea of doing hard things. I can’t learn and grow if I am not challenging myself and pushing myself to my limits. College isn’t easy but I embrace the challenge and opportunity to better myself intellectually. Not only is it beneficial for my current self but all of the growth and learning I do now can benefit me for the rest of my life.</p>
